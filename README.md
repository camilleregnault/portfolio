# Welcome to my Portfolio

Passionate about languages in general, I made my way to learn many foreign languages and experience foreign cultures.
I went into coding and discovered other kinds of languages, programming languages, for which I enjoy even more playing with their syntax and grammar.

> If we spoke a different language, we would perceive a somewhat different world.
