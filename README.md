# Welcome to my Portfolio


> If we spoke a different language, we would perceive a somewhat different world.


Passionate about languages in general, I made my way to learn many foreign languages and experience foreign cultures.
Then, I went into coding and discovered other kinds of languages, programming languages, with which I enjoy even more playing.

I have experience in marketing and customer service, this is why I work on user-oridented product and design.
